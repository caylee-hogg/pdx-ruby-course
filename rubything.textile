% THESE SLIDES ARE NOT GOOD - JUST A REALLY SILLY VERBOSE ROUGH DRAFT
% LET'S RIP THEM APART TO MAKE SOMETHING BETTER

h1. Outline of the Day


h1. What is programming?

* Programming is the act of writing programs
* A program is just text
* A program is a precise description of how to perform a *computation* on *data*
* Data
** Numbers
** Strings: pieces of text
** Lists of things
** Booleans: true and false
* Computations
** Add 3 and 4
** Find the largest number in a list of numbers
** Contact Trimet's network and find the most convenient bus route

h1. What is a programming language?

* A human readable format for describing computations
* Compilers or interpreters convert human-readable to machine-readable
* Any language can describe the same computations
* Different languages are really just different vocabulary 
* Different vocabulary means a difference in ease of expressing an idea

h1. Why Ruby?

* Easy to learn
* Strong community in Portland
* Rails gives Ruby a good, simple, vocabulary for web development

h1. Starting Ruby

instructions to start irb, a couple of words on how to navigate it?
Cute tricks, pitfalls?

% Okay, so one thing we need to do here is figure out just exactly what we'll
% do with respect to TryRuby. We can't, in some sense, just have people follow
% along at home because there's all sorts of cute stuff it does with an
% that we can't just replicate easily

h1. Basic Ruby Data

|Numbers | @1@, @2@, @3@|
|Strings | @"chicken"@ |
|Booleans| @true@, @false@|
|Symbols | @:chicken@ |
|Arrays | @[1 , 7, "cake"]@|
|Hashes  | @{:chicken => "chicken", :sillyexample => :chicken}@|

type these at the command line! What happens? 

That's the data, where are the computations?

h1. Basic Ruby Computations

| @2 + 2@ | |
| @3 * 3@ | |
| @"chicken".reverse@ | |
| @"chicken".length@  | |
| @2 + 2 == 4@ | |
| @2 + 2 == 5@ | |

h1. Basic Ruby Computations

| @2 + 2@ | @4@ |
| @3 * 3@ | |
| @"chicken".reverse@ | |
| @"chicken".length@  | |
| @2 + 2 == 4@ | |
| @2 + 2 == 5@ | |


h1. Basic Ruby Computations

| @2 + 2@ | @4@ |
| @3 * 3@ | @9@ |
| @"chicken".reverse@ | |
| @"chicken".length@  | |
| @2 + 2 == 4@ | |
| @2 + 2 == 5@ | |


h1. Basic Ruby Computations

| @2 + 2@ | @4@ |
| @3 * 3@ | @9@ |
| @"chicken".reverse@ | @"nekcihc"@ |
| @"chicken".length@  | |
| @2 + 2 == 4@ | |
| @2 + 2 == 5@ | |

| @2 + 2@ | @4@ |
| @3 * 3@ | @9@ |

| @"chicken".length@  | @7@ |
| @2 + 2 == 4@ | @true@ |
| @2 + 2 == 5@ | |

| @"chicken".length@  | @7@ |
| @2 + 2 == 4@ | @true@ |
| @2 + 2 == 5@ | @false@ |


h1. (more intro to ruby slides?)

Not sure what needs to go here just yet. More simple walthrough examples
of syntax, very monkey-see/monkey-do to begin with, explaining only what
we need

h1. Objects

Ruby is "object-oriented". A fancy way of saying that everything you can
manipulate in Ruby has both data stored in it and computations, called methods,
that can manipulate that data.

For example, "puppy" is a String and .reverse is a method that can reverse a
string - hence "puppy".reverse returns "yppup"

Need a table of examples here, perhaps. What things are Objects?

h1. Classes

Classes classifying objects. Describe the data and methods that can be
applied to them. (note that we're not getting into modules or mixins this weekend) Describe how to make a class, provide examples.

h1. Hashes

h1. Koans

(Addie should write what she wants here)

h1. Intro To Rails

(Give a more technical description of what Rails does: a system for generating
and handling classes to represent the data of your webapp)

h1. An Example Rails App

(directions for how to run this application and what to do with it as
examples - need a script for manipulating it in the web browser.
Need examples of 
# Viewing data
# Creating data
# Modifying data
# Destroying data
End with the Gospel(in the old German sense) of Rails: much of the code
needed to do those things can automatically be created by rails
)

h1. Rails console examples

So here we need probably 5-10 slides of rails for zombies like examples of how
this should all work

h1. Cont.

h1. Cont.

h1. The code behind the curtain

how to use scaffolding - should be a step by step guide of how we made this
and explaining what the commands are doing. I'm guessing quite a few slides
will go here.

h1. Wrap-up

What we learned, summarized in a few slides

h1. Stepping outside

(Reid will talk about the wider ecosystem and what to expect, etc.)
